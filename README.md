# Team 1 Group Project: InorOut

## Overview:
As a group we have collected data from outside sources to seekout some common reoccuring problems in everyday life. We noticed that in several household cases there's always a dispute on deciding "what to eat?". As developers we have tackled on this task by creating a website to allow users to either find nearby restaurants based off of a series of questions or discovering new recipes with common ingrediants at home!

When developing the application our group has set our MVP (Minimum Viable Product), based on two key main factors. First was what is the purpose of the app and how users accessible will it be, then what are our limitations on our Apis. 

Next is to situate an bugs within our project and find solutions that meet our criterias.

From there we're able to create and polish an additional things we wanted and needed into our application.

## Process:

1. Seek a target audience/demograph.

2. Develope A unique application that uses 2 different Apis to fulfill a request or  concept.

3. Create a user-friendly Landing Page.

4. Create two panels for each Api page.

5. Polish UI with a coding Framework.

6. Publish Site.

## User Story:

```
As a hungry and mobile coder
I want to code an assistant to help decide my next meal
So that I can utilize the resources we have/can use and/or
So that I can choose a restaurant near me based on my input criteria

```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
When loading InorOut
Then the user will be directed to a splash page.
When the user selects one of the two available options (Eat in or Eat out)
Then the user will be redirected to the corresponding page.
When the redirected page loads
Then the user will complete a form within a modal window.
When the user submits the form
Then the application will return results from one of two server-side APIs.
When user submits the form on the “Eat In” page
Then the application will return recipes from the Spoonacular API based on the User’s search criteria.
When the user submits the form on the “Eat Out” Page
Then the application will return restaurants, locations, and details from the Google Places and Static Maps APIs based on the User’s search criteria.
